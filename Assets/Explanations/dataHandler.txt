In the file data.json you can modify the weapon Stats or you can create new ones.
More over you can create new Chests or modify the spawn chances of existing ones.

Which data can be stored in the file can be seen in the dataHandler.cs file. 
Only variables of these objects can be read from the file.
If you want to have new stats for f.ex. the weapons you have to create a new variable in the object.

The file is in the following format:

{
    // weapon section
  "weapons": [
    // weapon object
    {
        // these are the stats of a weapon wich are currently available
      "id": 0,
      "name": "Pistol",
      "fireCooldown": 0.25,
      "damage": 5,
      "shootForce": 10,
      "speedWhileWearing": -1,
      "FOVWhileWearing": 0,
      "chestSpawnWeaponChances": [ // in this list there are the chances for each chest to appear in them
        {
            // f.ex. the chance that a Pistol is in the level zero chest if 75%
            // if you add the chances of all weapons of this chest level the result has to be 1
          "level": 0,
          "chance": 0.75
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  // chest section
  "chests": [
    // chest object with the chance to spawn after a room is cleared and a chest can spawn
    {
        // if you sum up all chest Spawn chances 1 has to be the result
      "chestLevel": 0,
      "chestSpawnChance": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
